# bjork-album-generator
This is a simple Flask web application that generates "Bjorkesque" album titles using Chat GPT's API and the text-davinci-003 engine.

How to use:
- Enter your own Chat GPT API key in the bjork.py file and serve on localhost:5000.
- Change the prompt, try a different engine, edit the index.html file and make one of your own!
